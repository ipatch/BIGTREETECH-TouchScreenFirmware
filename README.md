- in short this is my 🙋‍♂️ the BTT TFT screen FW, not much has changed, but if curious see commit log.

I pull in changes from the upstream master branch from this repo, then merge them into origin master, and then from there I merge the changes into **ibuild-bttTFT35v2** hoping there are little merge conflicts to deal with. 🤞


## TODOs

- [ ] figure out how to use the _custom1_ or _custom2_ menu items in the _preheat_ menu to add custom preheat temperatures. _time permitting_
